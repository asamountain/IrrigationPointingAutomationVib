# 📊 Live Dashboard - Option A (Prototype)

## What It Does

A **real-time web dashboard** that monitors your irrigation automation as it runs, showing:

- ✅ Current status and progress
- ✅ Live logs with timestamps
- ✅ Latest screenshot preview
- ✅ Interactive controls (Pause/Resume/Stop)

**Just like Vibium!** But in a separate browser tab.

---

## How to Use

### 1. Run the automation:
```powershell
npm start
```

### 2. The dashboard will automatically open in a new browser tab

You'll see:
- **Automation tab** - Running the irrigation report extraction  
- **Dashboard tab** - Monitoring and controls

### 3. Monitor in real-time

The dashboard updates automatically as the automation runs:
- Status changes (Running → Paused → Complete)
- Step-by-step progress bar
- Live logs scrolling
- Screenshots appearing instantly

### 4. Control the automation

Use the buttons:
- **⏸️ Pause** - Temporarily stop automation
- **▶️ Resume** - Continue from where you paused
- **⏹️ Stop** - End automation completely

## Technical Details

### Architecture:
```
┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│  Automation      │◄────────┤  Dashboard       │
│  (Main script)   │  HTTP   │  (Browser tab)   │
│                  │  +SSE   │                  │
│  Port: N/A       │         │  Port: 3456      │
└──────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘
        │                             │
        └─────────Screenshots─────────┘
```

### Components:
- `dashboard.html` - Frontend UI (HTML/CSS/JS)
- `dashboard-server.js` - Backend server (Node.js HTTP + SSE)
- `irrigation-playwright.js` - Main script (updated with dashboard integration)

### Communication:
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time updates from server to browser
- **REST API** for control commands (pause/resume/stop)
- **File serving** for screenshots

---

## Coming in Option B (Future)

🔮 **Full Control Panel** - Like a proper monitoring system:
- ✅ Multi-step visual progress tracker
- ✅ Screenshot carousel (view all captures)
- ✅ Live chart overlay (see detection points)
- ✅ Manual correction interface
- ✅ Extracted data preview (JSON/table view)
- ✅ Farm-by-farm status tracking
- ✅ Error notifications with retry options
- ✅ Export logs to file
- ✅ History of past runs

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard doesn't open?
**Check:** Port 3456 might be in use  
**Fix:** The server will try port 3457, 3458, etc. Check terminal for actual port

### Can't see screenshots?
**Check:** Screenshots folder exists  
**Fix:** The script creates it automatically, but verify path is correct

### Controls don't work?
**Check:** Connection to server (see browser console F12)  
**Fix:** Refresh the dashboard tab

## Why This Is Better Than DevTools

| Feature | DevTools | Dashboard |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Visual UI | ❌ Text only | ✅ Beautiful graphics |
| Screenshot preview | ❌ No | ✅ Live updates |
| Controls | ❌ Manual commands | ✅ Buttons |
| Progress tracking | ❌ No | ✅ Progress bar |
| Separate window | ❌ Docked | ✅ Full tab |
| Easy to understand | ❌ Technical | ✅ User-friendly |

## Next Steps

1. **Test it!** Run `npm start` and play with the controls
2. **Give feedback** - What features do you want in Option B?
3. **Continue at home** - All code is on GitHub!
